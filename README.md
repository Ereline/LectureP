# LectureP
The project is a prototype of a system for analyzing and creating academic materials.
The neural network transcribes the audio file and generates a glossary with complex terms. The description of the terms is taken from the context of the transcribed text from the audio file; in the absence of a definition, the term is parsed from third-party sources.
